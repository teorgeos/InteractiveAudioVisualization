# Summary
It is an interactive audio visualization project of the Ainu language for the Generative Audio Visualization course in 2024.
The project aims to visualize the forgotten audio of Ainu culture through simple interactions with symbolic objects of Ainu culture.

# Tools
Unity, C#

# Interaction & System Design
According to the weather API, the project automatically checks the snowfall depth and controls the particle systems.
At the very beginning, it will play the audio of Ainu's traditional instruments.
On the screen, the lines visualizing the instrument's shape and audio will automatically move up and down, controlled by the volume.
There are symbolic 3D objects without gravity. If the player clicks on them, they will play the voices of the Ainu.
The objects are adapted with physics, so they will move back and forth whenever the user clicks them.
They will also get bigger and smaller according to the volume.
Additionally, the 3D objects bounce while the instrument audio is playing.

# Background
The Ainu are an indigenous people from northern Japan.
I wanted to visualize forgotten audio and came up with the idea to visualize the Ainu language.
I visited Hokkaido, the northern island of Japan, and realized that their culture is still alive even if we cannot see or meet them in person.
